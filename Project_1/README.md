## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. All other libraries needed is declared within the file

If you are using firefox browser, checkout this Firefox plugin. Python Notebook Viewer.

This plugin lets you view/render python notebooks without running notebook server. Once installed, set Firefox as default app to open ipynb files. From now onwards, you can simply open ipynb files by simply double clicking on it!

Or else you can run google colab and upload this python notebook

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in studying the art and entertainment activities classification in Singapore from 2018 to 2020 :

    The effect of Covid has on the arts performance
