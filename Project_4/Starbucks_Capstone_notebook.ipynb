First we will explore, clean the data and then make exploratory analysis to find out customer based statistic. Subseqently, we aim to make on what the app should make recommendation offer to the new customer on the app with a machine learning model"

    "\n",
    "### Starbuck\n",
    "Starbucks Corporation is an American multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves headquartered in Seattle, Washington since 1971[1]. It is currently the world's largest coffeehouse chain store, serving a variety of beverages from hot/cold coffee/tea to the In addition to drinks and food, many stores carry Starbucks' official merchandise, such as mugs, tumblers, scoops, and coffee presses. Not limited to store front sales, drinks (canned drink, expresso capsules) sporting Starbuck label has appeared in supermarket and online shops[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mobile Application\n",
    "Starbucks is one of the early adopter of mobile application. In May 2008, a loyalty program was introduced for Starbucks Card registered users offering perks such as free Wi-Fi Internet access etc. 3 Years on, it began beta testing its mobile app for the Starbucks card, offering prepaid services. Subsequently, Starbucks released its complete mobile platform by January 2011. By December 2011, the number of mobile transactions exceeded 26 million. It is estimated that 30% of the Starbuck transactions is through mobile compared to Apple Pay, which is only used by ~5% of customers in 2018 [3]"

    "## Information on Data Set\n",
    "The provided data set for this project contains simulated data (containing transactions, customer spread and offer types) which mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks and not every user will have the same offer offered to the next\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Validity Period\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. For example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. The data set contains also informational offers which are merely providing information about a product. Accordingly, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, one can assumed the customer is under the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement. It can be shown from the transactional data shows the timestamp of each purchase as well as the amount of money spent when user make purchases on the app. The transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives, a record for when a user actually views the offer and finally when a user completes an offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, user should also note that it is possible that a customer using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rewards System\n",
    "To give an example how the reward process works, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has also to be considered that a customer can receive an offer, never actually views the offer, and still completes the offer. For example, a customer might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period, while he spends 15 dollars during those ten days. Thus there will be an offer completion record in the data set while the customer was not influenced by the offer.[2]"

    "## On Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is contained in three files:\n",

    "* profile.json - demographic data for each customer\n",
    "* transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you are using the workspace, you will need to go to the terminal and run the command `conda update pandas` before reading in the files. This is because the version of pandas in the workspace cannot read in the transcript.json file correctly, but the newest version of pandas can. You can access the termnal from the orange icon in the top left of this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how to access the terminal and how the install works using the two images below.  First you need to access the terminal:\n",
